# SSH Development Environment

Move your development environment into the cloud with a pausable EC2 server.

## Problem

You want portability and power, but a laptop is a poor trade. The development environment you're supposed to run locally can barely coexist alongside Chrome and Slack, and when you try to screen share or boot Sketch everything crunches to a halt.

## Solution

Move your development environment into a rentable EC2 instance, and manage costs by only running it when you need it.

The instance hibernates any time your computer idles. Resuming takes seconds.
